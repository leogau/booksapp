            <li>Before deciding to spend a lot of time on something, talk to experts to see if it's something you're actually going to like down the road. Don't just think, "Yea, I think would like doing this." Talk to people who've done it to find out for sure.</li>

        <p>Genuinely interesting people do genuinely intersting things.</p>

          <strong><em>The Three Laws of the Relaxed Superstar</em></strong>
        <ol>
          <li>The Law of Underscheduling: Pack your schedule with free time. Use this time to explore.</li>
          <li>The Law of Focus: Master one serious interest. Don't waste time on unrelated activities.</li>
          <li>The Law of Innovation: Pursue accomplishments that are hard to explain, not hard to do.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
          
        <h4>Part 1 - The Law of Underscheduling</h4>

        <p>You can't just use this free time to vegetate; you must fill it with unstructured exploration. That is, seek out things that seem interesting to you at the moment, and then <em>follow up</em> on whatever captures your attention most.</p>

        <p>It's not the activity that matters, but rather the effect the activity has on your personality. If you arbitrarily pick an activity and stick with it to demonstrate your persistence, you're probably wasting your time.</p>

        <p>Joining a community is one of the most important things you can do to foster deep interests and then nurture the projects they inspire. Here's my advice for taking advantage of [the power of communities]: If you have a casual interest in a topic, seek out and join a related community. Participlate regularly in this community, using the abundant free time generated by the underscheduled lifestyle to jump at small projects and opportunities as they arise. At this early stage, follow-through is critical.</p>

        <div id="list">
          <strong><em>The Advice-Guide Method</em></strong> provides an incredible head start for the pursuit of an interest.
        <ol>
          <li>Find examples of people who have succeeded in the field, and examples of people who did not succeed.</li>
          <li>Compare the success stories with the failure stories and identify where they differ.</li>
          <li>Contact one of the people who have succeeded and ask for specific advice.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <h4>Part 2 - The Law of Focus</h4>

        <p>The Superstar Effect -- the idea that the most talented in a field earn disproportionately more rewards than those who are only slightly less talented.</p>

        <p>Most people assume they know how to become good. Yet most are not good at anything. Question the assumptions you hold about how to become better at a particular pursuit.</p>

        <p>In every pursuit he eventually mastered, he started by ignoring his own assumptions and going straight to the experts.</p>

        <h4>Part 3 - The Law of Innovation</h4>

        <p>It's nearly impossible to think up an innovative activity from scratch. The paths they followed were long and circuitous. Obeying this rule is difficult because it requires patience.</p>

        <p>Closed communities are the sweet spot for innovation. A closed community is one that most people know about but whose operations they don't understand.</p>

        <p>To take action in such a community you must instead first prove that you belong. There's no shortcut here; you have to pay your dues.</p>

        <p>Stop seeking a flash of insight that will make you stunningly impressive all at once. Instead, get your foot in the door in the right type of community, do good work, and then once you understand the community and have earned its trust, begin to leverage.</p>

        <p>To enter a closed community with no established volunteer program, point out a real need that you can meet. Don't ask if they would allow you to volunteer for your own benefit; the focus should be on making their lives better, not the other way around.</p>
